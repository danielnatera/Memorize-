# Memorize! A React Memory Game

Developed by Luis Natera, this dynamic and interactive Memory Game project was meticulously crafted using React, showcasing the power and flexibility of one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. To enhance the styling and responsiveness of the application, TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework, was employed, allowing for a seamless and adaptive design experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Some features to point out in this project are i18n for supporting both english and spanish translations in the project and a dark mode impleented with Tailwind as well as a configuration panel where you can change you username and choose the difficulty of the game. The development of the project aimed to adhere to SOLID principles, promoting a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
